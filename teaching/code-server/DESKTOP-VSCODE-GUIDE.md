# Connecting Desktop VS Code to code-server

Guide for connecting desktop VS Code application to your existing code-server instances running on the teaching VM.

---

## Current Setup

You have 5 code-server instances:
- **Farish:** https://farish.lab.nexuswarrior.site (port 8445)
- **Dhruv:** https://dhruv.lab.nexuswarrior.site (port 8446)
- **Gautham:** https://gautham.lab.nexuswarrior.site (port 8447)
- **Nihita:** https://nihita.lab.nexuswarrior.site (port 8448)
- **Anand:** https://anand.lab.nexuswarrior.site (port 8449)

All accessible via browser ‚úÖ

**Goal:** Connect from desktop VS Code app to these workspaces.

---

## Method 1: SSH Remote Development (Recommended)

This is the cleanest approach - VS Code connects directly to the teaching VM via SSH.

### Advantages
‚úÖ Native VS Code experience (not browser)
‚úÖ Full access to workspace files
‚úÖ No port forwarding needed
‚úÖ Can access all kids' workspaces from one connection
‚úÖ Uses SSH keys you already have

### Setup Steps

#### 1. Install Remote-SSH Extension

In desktop VS Code:
1. Open VS Code on your Mac
2. Go to Extensions (‚áß‚åòX)
3. Search for: **Remote - SSH**
4. Install the extension by Microsoft

#### 2. Configure SSH Connection

```bash
# On your Mac, edit SSH config
nano ~/.ssh/config
```

**Add this configuration:**

```ssh
Host teaching-vm
    HostName 192.168.10.29
    User dev
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa
    ForwardAgent yes

# Alias for each kid's workspace
Host farish-workspace
    HostName 192.168.10.29
    User dev
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa
    RemoteCommand cd /home/dev/code-server-config/farish/workspace && exec $SHELL

Host dhruv-workspace
    HostName 192.168.10.29
    User dev
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa
    RemoteCommand cd /home/dev/code-server-config/dhruv/workspace && exec $SHELL

Host gautham-workspace
    HostName 192.168.10.29
    User dev
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa
    RemoteCommand cd /home/dev/code-server-config/gautham/workspace && exec $SHELL

Host nihita-workspace
    HostName 192.168.10.29
    User dev
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa
    RemoteCommand cd /home/dev/code-server-config/nihita/workspace && exec $SHELL

Host anand-workspace
    HostName 192.168.10.29
    User dev
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa
    RemoteCommand cd /home/dev/code-server-config/anand/workspace && exec $SHELL
```

#### 3. Connect from VS Code

**In desktop VS Code:**

1. Press `‚áß‚åòP` (Command Palette)
2. Type: `Remote-SSH: Connect to Host`
3. Select one of your hosts:
   - `teaching-vm` - Main connection
   - `farish-workspace` - Opens directly in Farish's workspace
   - `gautham-workspace` - Opens in Gautham's workspace
   - etc.

4. VS Code will open a new window connected via SSH
5. You'll see "SSH: teaching-vm" in the bottom-left corner
6. Open folder: `/home/dev/code-server-config/[kid-name]/workspace`

#### 4. Install Extensions on Remote

Extensions need to be installed on the remote server:
1. Once connected via SSH
2. Go to Extensions
3. You'll see two sections: "Local" and "SSH: teaching-vm"
4. Install extensions in the "SSH" section

**Recommended extensions (install on remote):**
- Python
- Black Formatter
- GitLens
- Error Lens
- PDF viewer

---

## Method 2: SSH Port Forwarding (Alternative)

Forward the code-server ports to your local machine.

### Advantages
‚úÖ Access via localhost
‚úÖ Works if you can't use Remote-SSH
‚úÖ Can access through browser at localhost

### Disadvantages
‚ö†Ô∏è Need separate tunnel for each kid
‚ö†Ô∏è Still uses browser-based VS Code (not desktop app)

### Setup Steps

#### Forward All Ports at Once

```bash
# On your Mac, create SSH tunnel with all ports
ssh -L 8445:localhost:8445 \
    -L 8446:localhost:8446 \
    -L 8447:localhost:8447 \
    -L 8448:localhost:8448 \
    -L 8449:localhost:8449 \
    dev@192.168.10.29 -N

# Keep this terminal open
```

**Then access via browser:**
- Farish: http://localhost:8445
- Dhruv: http://localhost:8446
- Gautham: http://localhost:8447
- Nihita: http://localhost:8448
- Anand: http://localhost:8449

#### Create Helper Script

Save this as `~/tunnel-code-servers.sh`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

echo "üöá Creating SSH tunnels to code-servers..."
echo "Press Ctrl+C to stop"
echo ""
echo "Access via:"
echo "  Farish:  http://localhost:8445"
echo "  Dhruv:   http://localhost:8446"
echo "  Gautham: http://localhost:8447"
echo "  Nihita:  http://localhost:8448"
echo "  Anand:   http://localhost:8449"
echo ""

ssh -L 8445:localhost:8445 \
    -L 8446:localhost:8446 \
    -L 8447:localhost:8447 \
    -L 8448:localhost:8448 \
    -L 8449:localhost:8449 \
    dev@192.168.10.29 -N
```

```bash
# Make it executable
chmod +x ~/tunnel-code-servers.sh

# Run it
~/tunnel-code-servers.sh
```

---

## Method 3: Direct Desktop VS Code Connection (Advanced)

Make code-server accept connections from desktop VS Code using code-server's CLI.

### Requirements
‚ö†Ô∏è This method is complex and not recommended
‚ö†Ô∏è Requires modifying code-server settings
‚ö†Ô∏è May conflict with browser access

### Why Not Recommended?

The LinuxServer code-server image is optimized for browser access. To connect desktop VS Code directly, you would need to:
1. Expose additional ports
2. Configure authentication differently
3. Handle SSL certificates
4. May break browser access

**Verdict:** Use Method 1 (Remote-SSH) instead.

---

## Method 4: VS Code Remote Tunnels (New!)

VS Code has a built-in tunneling feature.

### Setup

**On the teaching VM (for each code-server):**

```bash
# SSH to teaching VM
ssh dev@192.168.10.29

# Enter one of the code-server containers
docker exec -it farish-code-server bash

# Install VS Code CLI
curl -Lk 'https://code.visualstudio.com/sha/download?build=stable&os=cli-alpine-x64' \
  --output vscode_cli.tar.gz
tar -xf vscode_cli.tar.gz

# Start tunnel (requires GitHub login)
./code tunnel
```

This creates a secure tunnel via Microsoft's servers. You get a URL like:
```
https://vscode.dev/tunnel/[machine-name]
```

**Advantages:**
‚úÖ Access from anywhere (not just local network)
‚úÖ No SSH needed
‚úÖ Works through firewalls

**Disadvantages:**
‚ö†Ô∏è Requires GitHub account
‚ö†Ô∏è Data goes through Microsoft servers
‚ö†Ô∏è More complex setup for multiple users

---

## Recommended Setup for You

Based on your setup, I recommend **Method 1: SSH Remote Development**.

### Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Install Remote-SSH extension in desktop VS Code

# 2. Add to ~/.ssh/config on your Mac:
Host teaching-vm
    HostName 192.168.10.29
    User dev
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa

# 3. In VS Code:
#    ‚áß‚åòP ‚Üí "Remote-SSH: Connect to Host" ‚Üí "teaching-vm"

# 4. Open folder: /home/dev/code-server-config/[kid-name]/workspace
```

### For the Kids

If kids want to use desktop VS Code:

**Option A:** Give them SSH access (secure)
- Create SSH keys for each kid
- Add to teaching VM's authorized_keys
- Kids install Remote-SSH extension
- Kids connect via SSH

**Option B:** Port forwarding (simpler)
- You run the tunnel script
- Kids access via localhost URLs
- Still browser-based, but via localhost

**Option C:** Keep using browser (easiest)
- No changes needed
- Works exactly as it does now
- Browser VS Code is feature-complete

## Comparison Table

| Method | Desktop App? | Kids Can Use? | Setup Complexity | Best For |
|--------|-------------|---------------|------------------|----------|
| **Remote-SSH** | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚úÖ Yes (with SSH keys) | Medium | You, advanced users |
| **Port Forward** | ‚ùå No (browser) | ‚úÖ Yes | Easy | Quick local access |
| **Direct Connect** | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚ùå Complex | Very Hard | Not recommended |
| **VS Code Tunnel** | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚ö†Ô∏è Maybe | Hard | Remote access anywhere |
| **Keep Browser** | ‚ùå No | ‚úÖ Yes | None | Kids, current setup |

## Detailed Remote-SSH Setup for Kids

If you want kids to use desktop VS Code:

### Step 1: Generate SSH Keys for Each Kid

```bash
# On your Mac or their computer
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "gautham@fll" -f ~/.ssh/gautham_fll
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "nihita@fll" -f ~/.ssh/nihita_fll
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "dhruv@fll" -f ~/.ssh/dhruv_fll
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "farish@fll" -f ~/.ssh/farish_fll

# No password for kids (press Enter twice)
```

### Step 2: Add Keys to Teaching VM

```bash
# SSH to teaching VM
ssh dev@192.168.10.29

# Add each kid's public key
nano ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

# Paste the contents of:
# - gautham_fll.pub
# - nihita_fll.pub
# - dhruv_fll.pub
# - farish_fll.pub

# Save and exit
```

### Step 3: Give Kids Their SSH Config

Each kid adds to their `~/.ssh/config`:

**Gautham's config:**
```ssh
Host my-code-server
    HostName 192.168.10.29
    User dev
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/gautham_fll
    RemoteCommand cd /home/dev/code-server-config/gautham/workspace && exec $SHELL
```

**Nihita's config:**
```ssh
Host my-code-server
    HostName 192.168.10.29
    User dev
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/nihita_fll
    RemoteCommand cd /home/dev/code-server-config/nihita/workspace && exec $SHELL
```

(Similar for Dhruv and Farish)

### Step 4: Kids Install Remote-SSH Extension

1. Install desktop VS Code
2. Install Remote-SSH extension
3. ‚áß‚åòP ‚Üí "Remote-SSH: Connect to Host"
4. Select "my-code-server"
5. VS Code opens their workspace

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Could not establish connection to remote"

**Check:**
```bash
# Test SSH connection
ssh dev@192.168.10.29

# Verify SSH key
ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa dev@192.168.10.29
```

### Extensions not working in Remote-SSH

**Fix:**
- Install extensions in the "SSH: teaching-vm" section, not "Local"
- Some extensions only work locally (like themes)

### Port forward not working

**Check:**
```bash
# Test if port is open
nc -zv 192.168.10.29 8447

# Check if code-server is running
ssh dev@192.168.10.29 "docker ps | grep code-server"
```

### Kids can't connect

**Check:**
- SSH key added to authorized_keys?
- Permissions on ~/.ssh: `chmod 700 ~/.ssh`
- Permissions on authorized_keys: `chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys`

---

## Security Considerations

### If giving kids SSH access:

1. **Use separate keys** (done above)
2. **Restrict SSH access** (optional):
   ```bash
   # In ~/.ssh/authorized_keys, prefix each key with:
   restrict,command="cd /home/dev/code-server-config/gautham/workspace && exec $SHELL" ssh-ed25519 AAAA...
   ```
3. **Monitor SSH access:**
   ```bash
   tail -f /var/log/auth.log | grep "Accepted publickey"
   ```
